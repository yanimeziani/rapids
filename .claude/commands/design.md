# /design - Create UNIQUE Material Design 3 UI

Creates beautiful, accessible, adaptive UIs with UNIQUE brand personality - NOT generic cookie-cutter designs.

**Philosophy**: Material Design 3 is a SYSTEM for creative expression, not a template to copy.

## Usage
```
/design <component-name> <description>
```

## What it does
1. Analyzes design requirements and context
2. Generates Material Design 3 compliant designs:
   - Color scheme (light + dark themes)
   - Typography scale
   - Component specifications
   - Responsive layouts (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Motion and interaction specs
3. Provides implementation code:
   - Flutter Material 3 widgets
   - Material Web Components
   - Design tokens (JSON)
4. Creates design documentation
5. Validates accessibility standards

## Examples
```
/design user-profile-card "Unique card with tilted layout, custom gradients, playful animations"
```

```
/design app-navigation "Custom navigation with animated indicator, unique shape language"
```

```
/design color-scheme "Vibrant, high-energy color scheme from #6442d6 with custom tonal palette"
```

```
/design login-screen "Minimalist luxury design with custom typography and glassmorphism"
```

## Design Deliverables
- **Unique Color Palette**: Custom tonal palette expressing brand personality
- **Custom Components**: Unique variations with creative states and interactions
- **Creative Layouts**: Asymmetric, memorable grid systems
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant WHILE being distinctive
- **Code**: Implementation-ready Flutter/Web code with custom theming
- **Documentation**: Design rationale and customization details
- **Brand Identity**: Signature elements that make design instantly recognizable

## Material Design 3 Features
- **Dynamic Color**: Personalized color schemes from user preferences
- **Adaptive Design**: Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant by default
- **Components**: 30+ components (buttons, cards, navigation, inputs, etc.)
- **Typography**: Complete type scale (display → label)
- **Motion**: Purposeful animations with proper easing
- **Elevation**: Tonal elevation with surface tints

## Integration
- Works with `/new-feature` to design and implement features
- Exports design tokens for consistent theming
- Provides Figma-compatible specifications
- Generates Flutter `ThemeData` and Web CSS variables
